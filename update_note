1. In Line 24 in `src\dir_traversal_tfrecord.py`, `for list_index in xrange(len(tfrecord_list)):` => 
   `for list_index in range(len(tfrecord_list)):`.
2. If the files generated by running `python build_image_data.py` are not ended with `.tfrecord`, then manually add `.tfrecord` to each
   file so that they can be further processed by running `python read_tfrecord_data.py`
